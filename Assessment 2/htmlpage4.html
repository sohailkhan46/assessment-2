        1.Fifa 22
    </h1>
    <p id="paragraph">
        FIFA 22 received "generally favorable" reviews for the PlayStation 5, XBOX Series X, and PC versions of the
        game,
        according to review aggregator Metacritic.[35][36][37] The Nintendo Switch version, however, was widely panned
        by
        critics due to being largely unchanged from its predecessor, FIFA 21 (which itself was widely unchanged from
        FIFA 20 and
        FIFA 19).[42][43] In a review of the game by Bleacher Report, FIFA 22 was said to be the franchise’s best
        release in
        years with its HyperMotion feature. Some of those improvements include players reacting to impacts from strong
        passes
        and more agile players being noticeably more flexible and swift.[52] Moreover, the popular video game review
        website,
        IGN, states that FIFA 22 takes advantage of the graphical power of new generation consoles with deeper and more
        immersive visual effects.[53] IGN also stated that the FIFA 22 soundtrack was one of the most comprehensive
        playlists in
        recent years.[53]

        For the first time in the Fifa's history, here we have a real football simulator. The pace is lower than ever.
        The
        physics. The Keepers. The Nets. The sound of everything. More difficult to improve. More difficult to score.
        More
        difficult to dominate the game. And this is the best thing of Fifa 22. A videogame for adults. For people with
        experience. With courage. With passion for football. If you love football, congratulations. This is your game.

        Unlike last years release, there aren't too many noticable issues that need improving on either. EA have been
        afforded
        more time to get this game to where they need it to be, and they seem to have done exactly that. On the other
        hand
        though, there are still modes with untapped potential that EA have to put more focus on in order to appeal to
        their full
        market of players. It's a strong release from EA, one which will keep them at the top of the footballing sim
        market, but
        without a leading competitor to challenge them, that isn't awfully difficult.

        bob the moon,13 December 2013:</br>
        In the city of Los Santos, a young hustler falls under the wing of a former criminal living a difficult
        retirement.
        Circumstances lead to the pair to have to do a job to pay off a debt – a job which gets national coverage and
        draws
        unwanted attention from a former partner, corrupt cops, ruthless movie moguls, rival gangs, aggressive fitness
        fanatics
        and many others.

        I have played this game series on and off over the years but (criminally) did not play the former one based in
        Los
        Santos but instead rejoined with GTA4, a game I enjoyed but not one without its flaws. The good news with V is
        that the
        game keeps the strengths of the fourth game but makes many improvements which produce a much more fun and
        enjoyable
        experience across many aspects. The first thing to say is that the world of LS is technically amazing in terms
        of its
        attention to detail and beauty – it is hard to describe to people who decide they do not like these games, but
        to see a
        glorious sunset from a hillside, with perfect shadow effects and vegetation movement and know that someone
        designed and
        made this, not just filmed it, is something that hit me over and over throughout the game. The map is enjoyably
        large
        with diverse landscapes and character and I still find great pleasure in just going around in it even if I have
        nothing
        specific to do.

        The story is solid enough for the game even if it is rather generic and overblown. The characters are quite
        clichéd in
        some regards. Michael's story for instance is not so imaginative and generally I found him the least of the
        characters.
        Franklin is similar but covered by him being the "intro" character, so I stayed close to him throughout. Trevor
        is a
        wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up. The events
        of the
        story are necessarily overblown but this is part of the fun and generally I liked the flow to it. The many
        supporting
        characters are great fun and the energy and color of it all does cover up for the fact that the story is not
        really that
        complex or engaging at times. As it is though, it is about events and set-pieces and the game provides plenty of
        fun
        memorable missions (admittedly as well as a handful of awful ones), and in this way there are loads of missions
        to
        replay and enjoy and, most importantly, this game actually allows you to load them to do just that.

        Side missions add color and fun and, although I do miss ongoing missions like the vigilante ones from IV, there
        is still
        plenty to do. The range of vehicles adds to this and I also enjoyed how much easier they are to drive than in
        the
        previous game. Weapon customization and the range of them provide fun destruction, although the police are a lot
        more
        aggressive in this game than in IV, so it is harder to go on a rampage and make it last. In theory the Online
        world
        offers endless gaming – I tried it for one evening and it was fun despite all the issues, but the community
        seemed
        messed up and very reliant on having an existing group of players – it looks fun but I'm just more of an offline
        player
        these days.Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, even if you "only" play the days and days of content in the
        single player game.
        Technically the game is astounding with its attention to detail and just the sheer beauty of the audio and
        visual design
        of the whole world. The plot is solid enough to do the job while the characters (main and supporting) are
        colorful
        enough to engage while playing through missions which are mostly enjoyable and offer plenty of big set-pieces
        that are
        overblown and fun.

        The single-player story mode: 10/10

        The online multiplayer mode: 1/10

        The online in this game managed to derail this company's approach to DLC entirely. Remember Undead Nightmare for
        Red
        Dead Redemption, and Ballad of Gay Tony on GTA IV? Yeah, we'll probably never get DLCs like that from this
        company ever
        again. From now on it's going to be all about adding cosmetics and vehicles in the hopes of people saying screw
        it and
        buying in-game currency with real money instead of playing the purposely dull and repetitive missions with tiny
        payouts.

        My first Warzone win was full of highs and lows that I haven’t felt in other battle royale games, where dying
        can feel like hitting an invisible wall in the middle of a full sprint.After winning a few early fights in the
        TV
        Station, we all died to an enemy ambush and got sent to the Gulag.
        Amazingly, we all won our 1-on-1 fights and dropped right back into action. From there, we stuck to the shadows
        and slowly raised funds to call in our favorite custom loadouts. With my tried-and-true M4A1 kitted with a full
        suite of attachments, I ended with nine kills for a squad total of 20. For as much as Call of Duty: Warzone
        borrows from the best of its competition, it’s full of smart conveniences that are quickly making it my
        circle-shrinking murderfest of choice.A lot of it has to do with Warzone’s relaxed take on looting. Nothing
        turns me off
        battle royale more than spending 20 minutes fiddling with weapons, ammo, and attachments in and out of menus
        until I've
        reached a meta-approved level of battle readiness. That’s not how Warzone rolls. There are no backpacks—there’s
        barely
        even an inventory screen.
        and a genre where progression is earned through the luck of looting, Warzone wisely diverges with an in-game
        economy
        instead. The fastest way to make money and reach your ideal loadout is by completing contracts,
        randomly-generated side
        activities shared by the whole squad with big cash rewards. There are three types of contracts that can be as
        simple as
        capturing an objective. You don’t have to take them on, but they’re fun enough to always be worth it. Most
        importantly,
        they encourage players to stay on the move instead of “turtling” in a building and waiting for enemies to come
        to them.
        AdvertisementWarzone borrows a lot from standard Call of Duty that improves battle royale, but unfortunately one
        of its worst
        signature features has made the jump as well—killstreaks. For a fairly low price, players can buy killstreaks
        that can
        completely win a fight for you. The UAV stands out as the worse offender, as it periodically pings exact enemy
        locations
        within a city block. The only counter to is to equip a class using the Ghost perk. Just like in standard CoD
        multiplayer, it's not fun to face the choice of forgoing more interesting perks just so I can prevent my
        location from
        being broadcast to the world.</br>
        There are also the Cluster Strike and Precision Airstrike killstreaks, both of which can completely wipe an
        enemy squad
        if they don’t get out of the way. It's good for YouTube clips, I'm sure, and I like the idea of forcing squads
        out of a
        high ground position, but it gets way too ridiculous as the map area narrows.

        When a Warzone match is down to its last five squads in a small circle with no cover, everyone starts firing off
        their
        airstrikes at opposite corners hoping to get lucky kills. Unfortunately, it works. The overwhelming power of
        killstreaks
        is a completely uninteresting addition to Warzone, just as they are in every Call of Duty game since 2007. Much
        more
        interesting are Warzone’s field upgrades, another carryover from standard Modern Warfare. These lower-impact
        gadgets are
        more fun to use because they’re less powerful and require more critical thinking, like a grenade-blocking Trophy
        System,
        piloted scouting drone, or ammo box.
        Battle royale feels like the main mode in the Warzone package, but there’s another mode on offer that’s in a
        different genre entirely. Plunder takes place on the same Verdansk map, but there’s no circle, no Gulag, and
        infinite free respawns. The only goal is to make a bunch of money through killing players and completing
        contracts. You could compare it to a raid in Escape From Tarkov, but it’s actually closer to the The Division’s
        PvP Dark Zone mode.
        Plunder is undeniably more casual than Battle Royale. Even though you’re supposed to be making money, you can
        treat it
        as an aimless playground to practice shooting, grind levels for your weapons, or drive ATVs off sick ramps. It’s
        a great
        chaser to a tense round of battle royale.

        Family Fun
        Free fun but needs to be monitored by an adult, issues should be dealt with as they arise. We play as a family
        but as
        they have got older more and more friends are playing and adding them . I make sure they act to some degree as
        they
        would in the "real" world. Respectful of other people. As if it was a paint ball match / lazer tag gameto some
        degree.
        Head sets make it hard to hear what others are saying, but keeping communication open and dealing with issues in
        real
        time is a must. I have educated them on negatives and positives of multimedia and get them to try to monitor
        their game
        playing time as much as possible. They are mostly sensible but sometimes they stay on too long and they can see
        the
        negative impact it can have on them. When they grow up they won't have mum and dad to watch over them, so these
        are life
        skills they need to have in order to have good mental health. Game play is good but as a part of healthy

        eating well, active in the real world , reading books and doing art etc. Balance is key and every child is

        Fortnite has been with us for two years and, due to its status as a ‘game as a service’, we think it’s important
        to
        update our thoughts on it.

        In case you hadn't noticed, a lot has changed with the start of Fortnite's 11th season. For one, it's not called
        Season
        11 - instead it carries the moniker ‘Fortnite Chapter 2’, and in many ways it does feel almost like a sequel.At
        the end of Season 10, Fortnite's map was destroyed by a huge explosion, and swallowed by a black hole, watched
        by
        millions of players around the world. Those same millions waited days for any signs of life from Epic or the
        game's
        social accounts, and yet this period of inactivity only served to increase the hype levels - pretty impressive
        for a
        game that's already the world's most popular. It turns out that the one thing more talked about in gaming than
        playing
        Fortnite is the game being unavailable. How many games can dominate the conversation two years from launch?

        rtnite's new map will be what pulls in many lapsed players, but for our money it remains a variation on a theme.
        It
        retains the Dreamworks Animation aesthetic that has become so vaunted (and that helps it run on seemingly every
        platform), but the real draw here is the water.Previously as deep as a puddle, water has been completely
        redesigned in Fortnite Chapter 2. For one, you no longer
        simply waltz through it as if it wasn't there. Players can swim through the water (preventing use of weaponry
        but
        potentially allowing for a sneaky getaway), while you can also use boats to traverse it. These feel much more
        natural to
        play with or against than the previously added planes and mechs, and could bring back many players that were
        disappointed with those additions.
        There's even fishing, now, and while we have some serious concerns for the ecological state of the new map
        (being able to
        pull a shotgun or assault rifle from the bottom of a lake raises all sorts of questions about recycling), it can
        be a
        nice bonus when all you really wanted was a fish to eat for health.

        There's more to enjoy in the map than just the water, and on land players are now able to hop into dumpsters and
        haystacks to surprise passing opponents. Perhaps even more excitingly, you can now use environmental hazards
        like
        exploding gas stations to deal serious damage to enemies.

        Fortnite has always been at it's best when it revels in its own slapstick sensibilities, and Chapter 2 leans
        heavily
        into that. Aside from the aforementioned hiding spots, a ‘bandage bazooka’ allows for long range healing, while
        being
        able to carry comrades out of the line of fire is a neat new addition - help them up, and maybe they'll join you
        for a
        group high five (yes, there are group emotes now).Our favorite change for Fortnite Chapter 2, though, are the
        tweaks to the game's Battle Pass system. Whereas before you
        could go a whole match without completing one of the season's arbitrary challenges and therefore feel
        under-rewarded for
        your time, the game now offers seasonal XP and medals to help level you up just by playing the game. The
        challenges are
        still there, but those looking to just play a match without having to "loot 10 chests" or something like that
        will find
        the time they invest respected more.To summarize, Fortnite Chapter 2 breathes fresh life into a game that's
        built on reinvention. It's gone from gaming
        phenomenon to mainstream phenomenon, and it feels like witnessing a part of history - just with more XP now.

        PUBG is a good and unique ( the time it was launched) game which was based on Battle Royale format, where you
        get to
        choose between various modes of participation like solo or team. And all the players play at the real time which
        makes
        it even more interesting and easy to participate than earlier existing games. In earlier games, playing in real
        time was
        itself a project as you had to request for a space in existing rooms or create your own room and invite your
        team to
        play and all this process consumed time. But, with PUBG all this changed, all you have to do is log in and
        select the
        mode you want to participate in and all the other work is done by the game.This being a real-time game you have
        to constantly keep thinking about new strategies to win and implement your
        learnings simultaneously while playing.Over all its a good game if you want to use it for your benefits. But,
        yes we also have to be equally aware that we
        don't get addicted to the same. And this addiction can easily be avoided by defining specific exposure period
        like 30
        minutes or 60 minutes at max. This can help you being productive and developing at the same time.
        </br>
        As George Bernard Shaw rightly said -
        </br>
        “We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing”.
        Games build our Eye-Muscle Co-ordination, Analytical and Critical Thinking Skills and this is scientifically
        proven. Not
        just, PUBG but any Real-time strategy game like CSGO, StarCraft, Warcraft, Halo, COD, etc. can help you up your
        mental
        skills as you learn to build new strategies to clear new obstacles, you learn to improvise by learning from
        every
        mistake that you make.It is scientifically validated that you naturally lose neurons as you age and overtime,
        this can affect different
        aspects of memory. But, by stimulating your mind by mental activities like Meditation ( best practice) ,
        reading,
        acquiring new skill, playing games, etc. boosts Neurons production in our Brain and keep us mentally healthy
        always.

        Stay Healthy and Enjoy Life.

        One of the things that's made games like PUBG Mobile work on mobile is the increased power and screen size that
        mobile
        devices now offer. Across the board, smartphones are becoming better gaming devices. In the case of PUBG, we'd
        pick the
        phone over the Xbox, because we think it plays better (and the Xbox version has run into a number of problems).
        While the gaming experience is better on larger-screen devices – we have played it predominantly on the Samsung
        Galaxy
        Note 8 and 9 – it also plays well on lower power devices. We've played it on the Nokia 6, with mid-range
        hardware and at
        lower screen resolutions, so a good experience isn't the preserve of those with the most powerful or expensive
        phones.
        PUBG Mobile addresses a number of graphical elements to the game offering to automatically detect the best
        settings for
        you – but giving you control over the resolution, colouration and other settings. Importantly, you can also edit
        the
        frame rate if you find you're not getting a smooth experience.In reality, the biggest barrier to play that we've
        found
        is connectivity. If you don't have a good connection, you're likely to get lag and find your player doesn't
        respond and can't be controlled properly.
        That means you're likely to end up dead. And if you're dead, you can't win.Generally speaking the graphics are
        very good and the game does play smoothly

        – but it's important to make sure you have your brightness turned up and any night mode turned off as this will
        downgrade the visual experience
        One of PUBG’s beauties is that it’s not just about the combat. You actually spend relatively little time
        shooting – a
        risky business where you’re likely to get killed – and more time exploring your surroundings, searching and
        looting the
        various buildings and avoiding falling prey to an ambush or cheap sniper shot. There are vehicles to race around
        in and
        some top gear to collect, but your primary responsibility is just to not get killed – and if you make the odd
        kill along
        the way, all the better. It’s not like a Call of Duty or even a CounterStrike; it’s tense, nerve-wracking,
        unpredictable
        and immersive, with a layer of tactical depth that few other shooters can match. Psychologists and game
        theorists could
        write papers about how doors operate in PUBG.
        </br>
        The core game was brilliant long-before PUBG launched, but the team has made considerable strides in improving
        stability
        and performance (not always strengths) and just making it better. The added maps, for example, don’t merely vary
        the
        scenery but change the way you play. The original pseudo-Soviet island, Erangel, gives you the classic PUBG
        experience,
        while Miramar, the Central American desert map, has more challenging terrain, denser urban areas and lots of
        large,
        empty spaces where you’re at the mercy of snipers. It’s a map where you learn to move quickly and decisively
        then hole
        up a while to scavenge, always looking nervously at where the circle’s moving to.
        .It’s also a game where sound matters, gunshots in the distance providing your first warning that trouble might
        be
        getting near, quick footsteps in the immediate area letting you know to be on your guard. PUBG isn’t trying to
        build
        suspense but it does it anyway, each map packing in moments of rising tension or sudden shock scares. And while
        it can
        be a lonely experience played solo, it can also be a riot playing Duos or four-man squads, though not as much
        with
        random squad-mates as with friends.
