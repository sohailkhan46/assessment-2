    <p>FIFA 22 introduces "HyperMotion Technology,” which uses motion capture data collected from 22 real-life players playing
    a complete, high-intensity football match in motion capture suits. The data collected from player movements, such as
    tackles, aerial duels and on-ball actions informs FIFA 22 gameplay. According to an EA Sports press release, FIFA 22
    uses this data in its machine learning algorithm which uses over “8.7 million frames of advanced match capture” to
    generate life-like player movements and animations on and off the ball in real time.[3] This "HyperMotion" feature is
    only available on the 9th Generation and Stadia versions of the game, and has given rise to the slogan "Powered By
    Football."[4]
    The game features more than 30 officially licensed leagues, more than 700 clubs, and more than 17,000 players.[17] For
    the first time, the Indian Super League and its eleven teams were added, as well as the UEFA Europa Conference League,
    the third tier of European club football established in 2021.[18] New stadiums added in the game include the Estádio da
    Luz, home of S.L. Benfica, and the Nuevo Mirandilla, home of Cádiz CF.[19] Additionally, in January 2022 via an update,
    the Brentford Community Stadium, home of Brentford, was added to the game, thus ensuring all 20 Premier League teams
    have their respective stadiums.[20]
    
    Juventus, Roma, Atalanta and Lazio are not featured in FIFA 22, and are instead known as Piemonte Calcio, Roma FC,
    Bergamo Calcio and Latium respectively.[21] The game retains the players' likenesses, but the official badge, kits and
    stadiums are replaced with custom designs and generic stadiums created by EA Sports. Bayern Munich and Barcelona are
    also featured in the game with licensed players and kits, but do not have their stadium licenses and thus play in
    generic stadiums.
    
    Following a November 2020 announcement by Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds and American actor Rob McElhenney, through the RR
    McReynolds Company LLC, that they would be taking over the club,[22] Wrexham A.F.C. were included as part of the "Rest
    of World" section, becoming the first non-league team to be featured in the series.[23] Wrexham's last appearance in the
    FIFA series was in FIFA 08, when they were relegated from League 2 to the National League.

        In 2004,[i] Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff, North Yankton,
        resulting in the first being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family in the city of Los Santos
        under the alias Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with the Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB)[j] agent
        Dave Norton to stay hidden. Across town, gangster Franklin Clinton is working for a corrupt car salesman and meets
        Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess his son's car. The two later become friends. When Michael finds his
        wife sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The
        owner of the mansion, drug lord Martin Madrazo, demands compensation. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the
        money, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they
        rob a jewellery store to pay off the debt. Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor on the outskirts of Los Santos, hears
        of the heist and realises it was Michael's work; Trevor had believed Michael was killed in the Ludendorff heist. Trevor
        finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing Michael to reluctantly accept him back into his life.
        
        As time goes on, the lives of the protagonists spiral out of control. Michael's criminal behaviour prompts his family to
        leave him. When he later becomes a movie producer, he comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a billionaire venture
        capitalist and corporate raider, who attempts to shut down Michael's studio. Michael thwarts his efforts and
        inadvertently kills his assistant, causing Devin to vow revenge. Meanwhile, Franklin must rescue his friend Lamar Davis
        from his former friend and rival gangster Harold "Stretch" Joseph, who attempts to kill them to prove himself to his new
        gang. Concurrently, Trevor attempts to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County, waging war
        against The Lost outlaw motorcycle club, Latin American street gangs, rival meth dealers, private security firm
        Merryweather, and triad kingpin Wei Cheng.
        
        Having broken his agreement with Dave by committing heists again, Michael is coerced by Dave and his superior, Steve
        Haines, to perform a series of operations alongside Franklin and Trevor to undermine the International Affairs Agency
        (IAA).[k] Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack a convoy carrying funds for the IAA and steal an
        experimental chemical weapon from an IAA lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin
        to erase evidence against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities,
        destroying Steve's leverage over him.
        
        After reconciling with his family, Michael starts planning his final heist with Trevor, Franklin, and Lester: raiding
        the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as he was led to
        believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Deducing that he was
        supposed to be killed in Brad's place, Trevor feels betrayed and leaves Michael for dead following a standoff with
        Cheng's henchmen, causing friction within the group and threatening to undermine their plans. Meanwhile, Steve betrays
        Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, the IAA, and Merryweather. Trevor aids
        Michael and Dave, feeling only he has the right to kill Michael, agreeing to perform the Union Depository heist with the
        latter and part ways afterward.
        
        The heist is successful, but Franklin is afterwards approached by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a
        liability, and Devin, who seeks revenge on Michael. Franklin has three choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to
        save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with the man
        he spares and returns to his old life.[31][32] Otherwise, Michael and Trevor reconcile and the trio, aided by Lamar and
        Lester, withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Cheng, Stretch, Steve, and Devin.
        The three protagonists cease working together but remain friends.

        Modern Warfare takes place in modern time, with the campaign occurring over the course of several days in late 2019,
        and the Special Ops and multiplayer modes continuing the story into 2020. The campaign story centers around a rising
        conflict between Russia and the fictional Urzikstan, also involving Western military forces. Players assume the
        roles of three protagonists: SAS Sergeant Kyle "Gaz" Garrick (Elliot Knight), former Delta Force operative turned
        CIA SAC/SOG officer “Alex” (Chad Michael Collins) and Urzikstani rebel leader Farah Karim (Claudia Doumit). The
        three protagonists work together, alongside SAS Captain John Price (Barry Sloane) and CIA Station Chief Kate Laswell
        (Rya Kihlstedt). Other allies include United States Marine Corps General Lyons (Debra Wilson), Colonel Norris (Nick
        Boraine), and Demon Dogs leader Sergeant Marcus Griggs (LaMonica Garrett, later replaced by Demetrius Grosse)[b];
        Farah's older brother Hadir Karim (Aidan Bristow); "Nikolai" (Stefan Kapičić), a Russian private military company
        owner acquainted with Price; and Yegor Novak (Alex Feldman), a Ukrainian fixer working for Nikolai. The allied
        forces are opposed by the Al-Qatala, a terrorist organization based in Urzikstan led by Omar "The Wolf" Sulaman
        (Joel Swetow) and his right-hand man Jamal "The Butcher" Rahar (Nick E. Tarabay), as well as General Roman Barkov
        (Konstantin Lavysh), commander of a rogue Russian faction who treats Farah's rebel forces and the Al-Qatala equally
        as criminals.
    
        The Special Ops and Multiplayer seasonal story takes place after the events of the campaign, with players taking on
        the roles of various international operatives working for a joint alliance named "the Armistice". The operators are
        divided into two major factions: Coalition (comprising Western forces) and Allegiance (comprising Eastern forces).
        The Armistice's leaders are Captain Price, Laswell, General Lyons, and FSB Sergeant Kamarov (Gene Farber).
        Throughout the story, the operators come into conflict with the Al-Qatala, now under new leadership of Khaled
        Al-Asad, working together with Russian terrorist and arms dealer Victor Zakhaev (Dimitry Rozental). The seasonal
        story also introduces several new allies in both Coalition and Allegiance factions, including former CIA agent Mara
        (Carla Tassara), Spetsnaz operative Nikto (Gideon Emery), Task Force 141 recruits Simon "Ghost" Riley (Jeff Leach)
        and John "Soap" MacTavish (Neil Ellice), and Shadow Company mercenaries Marcus "Lerch" Ortega (Fred Tatasciore) and
        Rozlin "Roze" Helms (Jamie Gray Hyder).

        Fortnite began from an internal game jam at Epic Games following the publishing of Gears of War 3 around 2011. Though it
        was not initially one of the developed titles during the jam, the concept of merging the construction game genre,
        representing games like Minecraft and Terraria, and shooter games arose, leading to the foundation of Fortnite.[6][7]
        Development of Fortnite slowed due to several issues, including switching from the Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4, a
        deeper role-playing game approach to extend the life of the game, and a switch of art style from a dark theme to a more
        cartoonish style. Further, Epic was looking to get into the games as a service model, and brought in Chinese publisher
        Tencent to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives,
        including Cliff Bleszinski, who had been a key part of Fortnite's development. Fortnite's approach was changed to be
        Epic's testbed for games as a service, and further slowed the development.[8][7][9]
        
        Epic was able to prepare to release Fortnite as a paid early access title in July 2017, with plans to release it as
        free-to-play sometime in 2019 while gaining feedback from players to improve the game.[10][11][12][13] With the release
        of Fortnite Battle Royale, the player-versus-environment mode was distinguished as "Save the World". Ultimately, Epic
        opted to release Save the World as a premium title, bringing it out of early access on June 29, 2020.[14]
        Fortnite Battle Royale:
        Near the same time that Epic released Fortnite into early access, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds had become a worldwide
        phenomenon, having sold over 5 million copies three months from its March 2017 release, and drawing strong interest in
        the battle royale genre. Epic recognized that with the Fortnite base game, they could also do a battle royale mode, and
        rapidly developed their own version atop Fortnite in about two months.[15] By September 2017, Epic was ready to release
        this as a second mode from "Save the World" in the paid-for earlier access, but then later decided to release it as a
        free game, Fortnite Battle Royale, supported with microtransactions. This version quickly gained players, with over 10
        million players during its first two weeks of release, and leading Epic to create separate teams to continue the
        Fortnite Battle Royale development apart from the Save the World version, outside of common engine elements and art
        assets.[16][17] This allowed Fortnite Battle Royale to expand to other platforms otherwise not supported by Save the
        World, including iOS and Android mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch.[18][19]
        
        Fortnite Creative:
        A creative sandbox mode launched on December 6, 2018, synchronized with the start of season 7 of Fortnite Battle Royale.
        Each player has access to a private, persistent island on which they construct buildings and add and manipulate objects
        as desired. Players are able to invite friends to this island and participate in unofficial games such as race tracks or
        jumping courses.[20] Initially, only players who purchased the battle pass could receive their own island, whereas
        players who did not purchase it received access to the game mode for free on December 13.[21]

        The game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene, better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown, who had
        previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of popular mod DayZ, and inspired by the 2000
        Japanese film Battle Royale.[10][11] At the time he created DayZ: Battle Royale, around 2013, Irish-born Greene had been
        living in Brazil for a few years as a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer, and played video games such as
        Delta Force: Black Hawk Down and America's Army.[12][13] The DayZ mod caught his interest, both as a realistic military
        simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and started playing around with a custom server, learning programming as he went
        along.[12] Greene found most multiplayer first-person shooters too repetitive, considering maps small and easy to
        memorize. He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect, creating
        a high degree of replayability; this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized, and
        using random item placement across it.[14] Greene was also inspired by an online competition for DayZ called Survivor
        GameZ, which featured a number of Twitch and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left; as he was not a
        streamer himself, Greene wanted to create a similar game mode that anyone could play.[14] His initial efforts on this
        mod were more inspired by The Hunger Games novels, where players would try to vie for stockpiles of weapons at a central
        location, but moved away from this partially to give players a better chance at survival by spreading weapons around,
        and also to avoid copyright issues with the novels.[11] In taking inspiration from the Battle Royale film, Greene had
        wanted to use square safe areas, but his inexperience in coding led him to use circular safe areas instead, which
        persisted to Battlegrounds.[11]
        
        When DayZ became its own standalone title, interest in his ARMA 2 version of the Battle Royale mod trailed off, and
        Greene transitioned development of the mod to ARMA 3.[12] Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had
        become interested in Greene's work, and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1, licensing the battle royale
        idea from him.[12] In February 2016, Sony Online split H1Z1 into two separate games, the survival mode H1Z1: Just
        Survive, and the battle royale-like H1Z1: King of the Kill, around the same time that Greene's consultation period was
        over.[15]
        With the rapid growth of interest in the game, Bluehole spun out the entire development for PUBG into Bluehole Ginno
        Games in September 2017, which was renamed PUBG Corporation with Kim as its chief executive officer. PUBG Corporation
        continued the development of the game and its marketing and growth, opening an office in the United States with plans
        for future ones in Europe and Japan.[24] In August 2018, PUBG Corporation launched the "Fix PUBG" campaign,
        acknowledging that that game by then still had several lingering bugs and other performance issues.[25] The campaign
        finished in November, with PUBG Corporation calling it a success as everything listed had been implemented by then.[26]
        
        In March 2019, Greene announced that he was stepping down as the game's lead designer, but would still serve as a
        creative consultant. Tae-seok Jang, the game's art director, would replace him, with Green relocating to PUBG's studio
        in Amsterdam, PUBG Special Projects.[27] Greene stated that he believed the main PUBG team was at a place to continue
        developing the game in the direction he had set to keep the game unique among the other battle royale games it had
        launched, and he wanted to try something not tied to battle royale but still multiplayer-based. The move also put him
        closer to his family in Ireland.[28]
        
        With the success of PUBG, Bluehole created Krafton as a holding company for its video game assets and studios in 2018,
        taking over the publishing duties for PUBG and related games.[29][30] By December 2020, Krafton merged PUBG Corporation
        into their internal studio system, rebranding the team as PUBG Studios.[31]
