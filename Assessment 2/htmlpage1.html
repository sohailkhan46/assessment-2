    <p id="paragraph"> FIFA 22 feels more difficult than FIFA 21, which makes each match more competitive and initially rules out ridiculous
    high scorelines, particularly when playing offline games. Perhaps the most interesting and useful aspect in FIFA 22 is
    the advanced stats which now show at half-time and after every match.
    Career mode ;
    A single player “career mode” is featured in FIFA 22, where the user can play as a player or manager throughout a
    15-year career.[5] FIFA 22 introduces a create-a-club option in manager career, allowing players to design a new club
    with customized kits, crest, and home stadium.[6] Career mode introduces a level feature where users can advance their
    player by collecting experience points that unlock player skills and “perks” to improve stats.[7]
    
    Ultimate Team ;
    FIFA 22 Ultimate Team is a game mode where users can create a team and play online or offline games to earn various
    cards like “FUT Heroes” to add to their team.[8] FIFA 22 Ultimate Team introduced "FUT Heroes" cards that represent
    different players with special ratings and attributes.[9] The full heroes card list includes: Mario Gómez, Tim Cahill,
    Diego Milito, Jorge Campos, Fernando Morientes, Sami Al-Jaber, Robbie Keane, Abedi Pelé, Clint Dempsey, Lars Ricken, Ole
    Gunnar Solskjaer, Antonio Di Natale, Iván Córdoba, Freddie Ljungberg, Jürgen Kohler, Jerzy Dudek, Aleksandr Mostovoi,
    Joe Cole, and David Ginola.
    
    In order to keep the users of the game entertained, promotions of the cards of the players are applied. These promotions
    are made when there are important events worldwide such as Christmas or Halloween. However, there are also promotions
    regarding events in the FIFA community such as the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League or UEFA Conference League.
    Two of the most important promotions in the video game season are the team of the year (TOTY) where the best 12 players
    of the year are celebrated and the team of the season (TOTS) where the best players of the most advanced leagues are
    celebrated. important in the world. All of these promotions include improvements to player statistics, from physical
    attributes to sports attributes such as skill moves stars.
    
    As in FIFA 21, notable former players are given "icon" cards, similar to "FUT Heroes". New players added for FIFA 22
    include Iker Casillas, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Cafu. Players have the option to preview Silver and Gold
    player packs as in the previous game, by allowing players to preview what they would receive from a pack before deciding
    whether to purchase it. "Icon" cards are classified as extremely rare, the probability of getting one from a player pack
    is below 1%.[10]
    
    VOLTA Football ;
    New VOLTA mechanics in FIFA 22 will allow players to trigger special abilities during a match that would boost a
    player's avatar in a specific attribute. There will be three Signature Abilities available: Power Strike, Pure Pace and
    Aggressive Tackle.[11] Players of FIFA 22 will also have the opportunity to play with up to three players in various
    online mini game modes, which will be part of the new VOLTA Arcade.[12]

    <p id="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game[2] played from either a third-person[3] or first-person
    perspective.[4][b]
    Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.[5] Outside of the
    missions,
    players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area, including the fictional
    Blaine
    County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.[6][c]
    It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more
    gameplay content.[8]The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and
    Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only
    one character and others feature two or three.[18] Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will
    by a directional compass on the HUD, although this feature becomes restricted at various points throughout the story.
    The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete specific objectives. A character's compass
    avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.[19] Though
    players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from
    AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a
    successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward[20] and may be available for later missions with improvements to
    their unique skills.[21] Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily
    subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.[22]Each character has a
    set of eight skills that represent their ability in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve
    through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default (e.g. Trevor's flying skill).[23] The eighth
    "special" skill determines the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each respective character.
    Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to
    enemies while taking half as much in combat.[24] A meter on each character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used
    and regenerates when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or performing
    headshots as Michael).[25]
    
    While free-roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as scuba diving and BASE
    jumping, and visit businesses such as cinemas and strip clubs. Each character has a smartphone for contacting friends,
    starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet.[26] The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock
    market.[27] Players may purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons and vehicles in each
    character's arsenal, and customise their appearance by purchasing outfits, haircuts and tattoos.

    <p id="paragraph">As a first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in control of an infantry soldier who makes use of various
    authentic World War II firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives that are marked on the heads-up
    display's compass; the player must complete all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can save and load
    at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later Call of Duty games.
    
    The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot, and can carry up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with
    those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to
    toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early first-person
    shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the gun's actual
    sights for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon
    emplacements are controllable by the player.
    
    The game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of health reflected by a health bar. Medkits
    scattered throughout the levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore health when the player is injured.
    
    Call of Duty also featured "shellshock" (not to be confused with the psychological condition of the same name): when
    there is an explosion near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated tinnitus, appropriate sound "muffling"
    effects, blurred vision, and also results in the player slowing down, unable to sprint.
    
    As the focus of the game is on simulation of the actual battlefield, the gameplay differed from many single-player
    shooters of the time. The player moves in conjunction with allied soldiers rather than alone; allied soldiers will
    assist the player in defeating enemy soldiers and advancing; however, the player is given charge of completing certain
    objectives. The game places heavy emphasis on usage of cover, suppressive fire, and grenades. AI-controlled soldiers
    will take cover behind walls, barricades, and other obstacles when available.

    <p id="paragraph"> Fortnite: Save the World is a player-versus-environment cooperative game, with four players collaborating towards a
    common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the
    population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like "husks". The players take the role of
    commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either
    collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which
    include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained
    experience to improve their attributes.
    Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in
    a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the
    game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay
    alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in
    size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to
    quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player,
    duo, or squad remaining is the winner.
    Fortnite Creative is a sandbox game mode, in which players are given complete freedom to spawn any item from the Battle
    Royale gamemode on a personal island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges,
    and more.
    Players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood,
    brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls,
    floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have
    different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within
    Save the World this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to
    lure husks through. In Battle Royale, this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy
    fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in
    Creative.
    
    While Battle Royale and Creative are free-to-play, Save the World is pay-to-play.[3] The games are monetized through the
    use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing
    missions and other achievements in Save the World. V-Bucks in Save the World can be used to buy loot boxes, in the form
    of piñatas shaped like llamas, to gain a random selection of items. In Battle Royale, V-Bucks can be used to buy
    cosmetic items like character models or the like, or can also be used to purchase the game's battle pass, a tiered
    progression of customization rewards for gaining experience and completing certain objectives during the course of a
    Battle Royale season.[4][5]

        PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of
        large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the
        match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[1]
        
        Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the eight maps, which have areas of approximately 8
        × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi), 3 × 3 kilometres (1.9 ×
        1.9 mi), 2 × 2 kilometres (1.2 × 1.2 mi) and 1 × 1 kilometre (0.62 × 0.62 mi).[2] The plane's flight path across the map
        varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1]
        Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players
        can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are
        procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having
        better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from
        the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and
        situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to
        eliminate some advantages.[3]
        
        Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught
        outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in
        time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.[4] This results in a
        more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.[1] During the course of the match, random regions of
        the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.[5] In both cases, players
        are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety.[6] A plane will fly over various
        parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package,
        containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke,
        drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations.[1][7] On average, a full round takes no more
        than 30 minutes.[6]
        
        At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to
        purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization.[8] A rotating "event mode" was added
        to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or
        altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map.[9]
